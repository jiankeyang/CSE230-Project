# Project Proposal: Snake
## Overview

This project aims to develop an interactive version of the classic arcade game Snake using Haskell, with a primary focus on utilizing the `brick` library for terminal-based UI. The game involves a snake moving around a plane, consuming food, and growing in length while avoiding collisions with itself or the game boundaries.

## Core Functions

* **Basic Gameplay Mechanics**: Implement the fundamental mechanics of Snake, including snake movement, food generation, and score tracking.
* **Terminal-Based UI**: Utilize the `brick` library to create a responsive and visually appealing terminal interface.
* **Game State Management**: Efficiently handle game state changes (e.g., snake growth, food consumption) in Haskell, showcasing functional programming paradigms.

## Additional Features

We plan to implement some of the add-on features listed below.

* **Difficulty Levels**: Introduce multiple difficulty levels by varying the speed of the snake or complexity of the layout.
* **Leaderboard**: Implement a local leaderboard to track high scores, encouraging repeated play.
* **Customizable Appearance**: Allow players to customize the appearance of the snake and game board (e.g., colors, symbols).
* **Power-Ups**: Introduce power-ups that temporarily modify gameplay, such as speed boosts or score multipliers.
* **Replay Functionality**: Provide a replay feature to allow players to view past games.
* **Random Map**: Generate random maps with diverse boundaries and obstacles.
* **Multiplayer Mode**: Explore the possibility of a local multiplayer mode where two players can compete on the same board.
